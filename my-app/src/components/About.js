                I'm an avid traveler and love learning new languages. In addition to learning human 
                languages, I also enjoy learning programming languages such JavaScript, Ruby and Python.
                I'm currently learning fullstack development. I hope to use my programming skills with remote
                work abroad where I can also continue developing my human languages such as French and Spanish.
